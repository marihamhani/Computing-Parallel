# Distributed and Parallel Computing - Cassandra Assignment

## Overview
This project sets up a Cassandra cluster running sensor data storage with a single keyspace and one table.

## Docker Compose
- Modified `docker-compose.yml` contains only the Cassandra service.
- Run `docker-compose up -d` to start Cassandra.

## Schema
- The schema is defined in `schema/schema.cql`:
  - Keyspace: `sensor_data`
  - Table: `environmental_readings` with 10 columns including id, timestamp, location, temperature, humidity, etc.

## Sample Data Insertion
- Python script `insert_and_plot.py` inserts simulated sensor readings.
- Data includes random values for temperature, humidity, solar irradiation, and timestamps.

## Queries
- Example query to get readings for Tbilisi:
  ```cql
  SELECT * FROM environmental_readings WHERE location='Tbilisi' ALLOW FILTERING;
